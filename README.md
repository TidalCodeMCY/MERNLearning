# MERNLearning

Learner Projects from mern tutorials from freecodecamp youtube. Check them out at freecodecamp.com to learn all about how to code they are an amazing resource!
We will use these projects to help us learn the MERN stack as well as a good template hopefully for folder layout and project layout.

The Goals of this

- Learn the MERN Stack
- Learn more about commenting and project layout.
- Get better at coding overall :)
